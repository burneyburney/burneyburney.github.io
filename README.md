# quick and dirty angular (1.5) project  
hosted on ->  https://burneyburney.github.io    
## order of operations
~~1.  add (simple) boilerplate / file structure~~  
~~2.  agree upon a theme (selling rare legos)~~  
~~3.  agree on color pallet~~  
~~4.  import what you learned from past angular project~~  
~~5. build upon past skills to what you know now~~  
    ~~6.  making everything responsive / mobile friendly~~ (half done, you can squish window on desktop but on cell phone it could be better)  
    ~~7.  launch onto github pages~~ (did this first )  
    ~~8. add a few more content and go home~~  

    9.  tell EVERYONE what you created and link them to it no matter how bad this turns out... or you might as well have not done it at all.


# Wrap up notes

What I wish could have been done different ->    used a cool trick or two but I havn't learned anything 'Revolutionary' yet.

What I plan to do -> Build upon these skills to make something cool. like a word puzzle game with lots of animations ;)  

What was the Biggest Challenge -> Remembering how to communicate with the controller, documenting my progress constantly and naming things.
