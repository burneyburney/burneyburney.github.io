# quick and dirty angular (1.5) project  

## order of operations

~~1.  add (simple) boilerplate / file structure~~  
~~2.  agree upon a theme (selling rare legos)~~  
~~3.  agree on color pallet~~  
~~4.  import what you learned from past angular project~~  
~~5. build upon past skills to what you know now~~  
_time check in -> 8:30pm  _  
    ~~6.  making everything responsive / mobile friendly~~ (half done, you can squish window on desktop but on cell phone it could be better)  
    ~~7.  launch onto github pages~~ (did this first )  
   _time check in( going on a walk) -> 8:52pm_  

    8. add a few more content and go home
    9.  tell EVERYONE what you did... or you might as well have not done it at all.
